📰 News Analysis App

News Analysis App is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze news articles. The app allows users to extract key insights, perform sentiment analysis, generate word clouds, and visualize trends from news data.

This project aims to help journalists, researchers, and general users understand news articles better, detect biases, and gain meaningful insights from textual data.
A Streamlit-powered News Analysis Application that enables users to analyze news articles using NLP techniques, visualization tools, and AI-powered insights.

📌 Why This Project?
In the digital age, news is constantly being generated and circulated. However, misinformation, biases, and overwhelming amounts of content make it difficult to extract meaningful insights. This project:
✅ Automates news processing – No manual reading required, just input an article link!
✅ Identifies hidden patterns – Uses NLP models to extract keywords, topics, and sentiments.
✅ Detects news sentiment – Helps understand if an article is positive, negative, or neutral.
✅ Enhances research & reporting – Journalists and researchers can quickly analyze multiple articles

🏆 Features & Functionalities

🔍 1. News Scraping & Extraction
Input a news article URL, and the app fetches the content.
Supports various news sources (BBC, CNN, NDTV, etc.).
